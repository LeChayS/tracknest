## Getting Started

Before installing my project, you need to install the following things.

1. Install [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en) use the following commands:

```sh
# Download and install Chocolatey:
powershell -c "irm https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1|iex"

# Download and install Node.js:
choco install nodejs-lts --version="22"

# Verify the Node.js version:
node -v # Should print "v22.13.0".

# Verify npm version:
npm -v # Should print "10.9.2".
```

2. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

3. Install [Very Good Cli](https://cli.vgv.dev/)

```bash
dart pub global activate very_good_cli
```

## Run Project

After installing all the following above it's time for the next step

1. Clone the project

```bash
Â  git clone https://link-to-project
```

2. Go to the project directory

```bash
Â  cd tracknest
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
Â  flutter pub get
```

4. Run (development)

```bash
Â  flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart
```

## Running Tests

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Translations

This project relies on [flutter_localizations](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations-library.html) and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization).

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
 "@@locale": "en",
 "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
 "@counterAppBarTitle": {
 "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
 }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
 "@@locale": "en",
 "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
 "@counterAppBarTitle": {
 "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
 },
 "helloWorld": "Hello World",
 "@helloWorld": {
 "description": "Hello World Text"
 }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:tracknest/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
Â  final l10n = context.l10n;
Â  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
 ...

Â  Â  <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
Â <array>
Â  <string>en</string>
Â  <string>es</string>
Â </array>

 ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ l10n
â”‚ Â  â”œâ”€â”€ arb
â”‚ Â  â”‚ Â  â”œâ”€â”€ app_en.arb
â”‚ Â  â”‚ Â  â””â”€â”€ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
 "@@locale": "en",
 "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
 "@counterAppBarTitle": {
 "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
 }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
 "@@locale": "es",
 "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
 "@counterAppBarTitle": {
 "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la pÃ¡gina del contador"
 }
}
```

### Generating Translations

To use the latest translation changes, you will need to generate them:

1. Generate localizations for the current project:

```sh
flutter gen-l10n --arb-dir="lib/l10n/arb"
```

Alternatively, run `flutter run` and code generation will take place automatically.

## Note

### About the project environment

Because this project was created using Very Good Cli, it contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Tracknest works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

But to our fav, we only use **development** env because we don't use the other (staging and production) much, and deleting or config the project again may take us a while

## Merge, Branch and Commit Rules

### 1. Create branch

New branch always created from _**main**_ (or _**develop**_)

1. Use `git checkout main` to checkout _main_

2. To update the newest things of _main_ to local, use `git pull`

3. `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to create a new branch from _main_

\*_Note_: before push the new branch up to repo, **ALWAYS** checkout _**main**_ version on repo and local is the same (or **up-to-date**)

- `git pull origin main` to update all the newest things on _main_ to local

- up the branch to repo by `git push`

### 2. Naming branch

Following this rule

```bash
<type>/#<issue_number>-<issue_title_in_english>
```

In which

_<type>_ are:

- feature: new feature
- bugfix: bug fixing when found out a bug
- hotfix: serious bug that needs to be fixed immediately on _main_
- revert: revert back to the previous commit
- update: change feature or logic available

_<issue_number>_ is the number of the issue on Github Issue

_<issue_title_in_english>_ is the name of the issue but in English

### 3. Commit name

```bash
<type>/<change content>
```

In which _<type>_ are:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- revert: Reverts a previous commit
